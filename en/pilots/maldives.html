Although small (with a population of around 115,000) the city is flooded with waste - mostly plastic and styrofoam as everything is imported. Currently, there are very little tools and facilities for people to recycle their plastic waste, so we created a plastic recycling workspace inside a shipping container to educate locals on recycling and show how to transform plastic waste into valuable things.</p><img src="images/00.jpg" srcset="images/00.jpg 500w, images/00.jpg 1080w, images/00.jpg 1600w, images/00.jpg 2000w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 93vw, 69vw" alt="" class="img-pilots-big">

We sourced a 40 ft container from Rotterdam Harbour, (easier than expected) and started converting it into a Precious Plastic workspace 🙂Jerry started building the machines while Dave worked on transforming it into a living recycling centre. It took us around 2 months to transform the container, with a final push from our awesome 30+ community members that came from all over Europe to help us with painting 💪<a target="_blank" href="https://davehakkens.nl/preciousplastic/behind-the-scenes-of-the-first-precious-plastic-pilot/"><br></a></p>

          <h2 class="pilots-h2"><strong>WHAT WE&#x27;VE LEARNED</strong></h2>
          <p class="paragraph-pilots">As always going to a new country across the planet comes with lots of new challenges and troubles, but as you can imagine lots of learnings. Here is a few:<br>1. Rust: A lot of it. Maybe obvious, but it was something we hadn’t encountered before, everything had to be sanded down and repainted, and we had to buy a lot of new stainless steel nuts and bolts. <br>2. Plumbing parts hard to find: As everything rusts from the ocean, it seems that all plumbing parts are made from plastic so they can last, so finding steel parts was tricky!<br>3. Small, but handy: Even though Male is a small island there were lots of hardware stores and handymen we could count on.Converting a container is fun, but takes time. <br>4. Containers are big metal boxes, and with that comes a lot of work.<br>5. The temperature of the container: It was surprisingly cool and fresh to work in, we imagined it being an oven but it wasn’t actually that bad.<br>6. Male: Male is not how you imagine the Maldives, forget the white beaches and sand, this is just pure concrete, skyscrapers and chaos. <br>7. A lot of PET available: From our visit, we noticed that Maldivian people don’t really drink the tap water, so there is an abundance of imported plastic drinking bottles - so a lot of precious material lying around.<br>8. Painting the container: takes longer than you think, and it costs a lot - around €700.<br>9. Maldivian people are very helpful: every morning they would show up a few minutes after us in big groups all wanting to work and contribute towards the project - even if they had no idea what Precious Plastic was :)<br>10. More conscious than we thought: ‘Plastic bag free’ schools and similar incentives that made us smile. It’s really nice to see this kind of thinking in schools. <br>11. Cooling time: Moulds take a lot longer to cool in the Maldives, so always have a bucket of cold water nearby if you work in similar conditions.<br>12. Teaching: We found that as the compression oven is a much slower process, the injection machine and extruder are better for teaching as you get faster results.<br>13. Parata is good food: Better than chapati, but it’s very oily.<br>14. Shipping: shipping a container halfway across the world is simpler than you think, also shipping machine parts.<br>15. Placing the container level is important: if not, things like the big door cannot be closed properly. So if you want to take full advantage of your container it is best to place it on a level surface and add support where needed.<br>16. Making beam moulds was simpler than we imagined: We sourced a scrap rectangular tube, welded it onto the metal sheet at one end, and to our surprise, it worked the first time!<br>17. Bura Budah music: it was fun to listen to music from the Maldives, instead of Western music we usually listen to.<a target="_blank" href="https://davehakkens.nl/preciousplastic/behind-the-scenes-of-the-first-precious-plastic-pilot/"><br></a></p>

        <p class="paragraph-pilot white">Pilots are unique opportunities to test Precious Plastic ideas, technologies and processes on the ground. We collaborate with different institutions, partners and organisations to create Precious Plastic workspaces around the world. <br><br>We do pilots for two main reasons: research and testing. Working in different countries, with people of completely different cultures, realities, needs and drives help us understand the problem in a more informed and practical way. This field research is then used to develop Precious Plastic in more meaningful, accessible and applicable manners enabling ever more people around the world to work with plastic waste. While on the ground we also stress test our ideas, machines and systems to try and make successful plastic recycling workspaces in different parts of the world. <br><br>We like to make the mistakes, fail, pivot and find a better solutions. So others like yourself don’t need to make the same mistakes again. Trying to make plastic recycling easier and more affordable for others around the world.</p>
