<p>Unfortunetly we aren’t be able to answer all of your questions. We are just a tiny group of people working on this. We wish we could reply every one but we haven’t got enough time to do this. Feel free to make a donation though,  hopefully one day we will be able to hire someone for the job.</p>

<h2>Community</h2>
