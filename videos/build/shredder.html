<h2>About the shredder</h2>
<p>Plastic waste is shredded into flakes which will be used in the other machines to create new things. You can select the output size of these flakes by changing the sieve inside the machine to create different patterns and processes.</p>

<h2>Technical drawings</h2>
<p>You can find all the technical drawings to build this machine in our <a href="/videos/download/">download-kit</a>. They are divided into different steps and contain all the dimensions you need to build to machine.</p>

<h2>3D overview</h2>
<p>A little sotry about the possibilitires of this machine what you can make with it. the machine can do. morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams.</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output of the shredder isn’t super sexy. Just some chopped plastic flakes. However you can change the size of these flakes by changing the sieve. Different sizes of flakes will give a different pattern, smaller flakes melt easier but take longer to shred. Play around and see what works the best for you!</p>
